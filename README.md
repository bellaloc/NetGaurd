#NetGuard: Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

NetGuard is a simple yet effective Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) implemented in Python using the Tkinter GUI toolkit and the Scapy library for packet sniffing. It provides real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic to detect potential intrusions or anomalies.

#Features

Start/Stop packet sniffing with the click of a button.
Real-time analysis of network packets to detect anomalies.
Basic machine learning-based anomaly detection (packet size threshold).
Alert notifications for detected anomalies.
Simple and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

#Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/bellaloc/netguard.git

#Install the required dependencies:

pip install scapy

#Usage

#Navigate to the project directory:

cd netguard
Run the main_gui.py script:
Copy code
python main_gui.py
Click on the "Start Sniffing" button to initiate packet sniffing.
Monitor the GUI for any alerts generated for detected anomalies.
Click on the "Stop Sniffing" button to stop packet sniffing.
